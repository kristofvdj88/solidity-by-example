# Solidity by Example 2 - Open Auction

Following the Solidity Example tutorials found in the [Official Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html), we focus on an [Open Auction contract](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html#simple-open-auction). Take a look at the documentation, where you'll find the basic version of this contract, without the unit tests and client application.

### Prerequisites:

- IDE
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

In this repository you'll find a client with some basic UI to perform the various contract transactions and display its states and also you'll also find unit tests testing the various functions of the contract.
